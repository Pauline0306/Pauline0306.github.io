			Hi, I'm Pauline Astorga. I'm currently a 3rd-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science 
            in Information Technology at Gordon College.
			Information Technology wasn't my first course choice because my dream was to become a flight attendant, 
            but for some reason, I ended up in technology. 
			Now, my dream is to become a web developer and gain more knowledge about the tech industry. 
			However, I'm not yet confident in my skills and know I still have a lot to learn in IT.
			Being an IT student isn't easy, but nothing is too hard when you're willing to learn.
		</p>

			I'm a simple girl who doesn't know how to put on makeup or ride a bike, but I'm a little sporty. 
            I know how to play basketball, bowling, and track and field.
			I love watching sunsets, visiting the beach, and being in nature. 
            I'm also interested in traveling to different places here in the Philippines.
			I enjoy hanging out with my friends, spending time with them, and talking about life.
		</p>

		<p>I'm looking forward to the coming years, where I see myself becoming a web developer. 
			This portfolio will be filled with posts of my achievements and successes in life. 
            Nothing is impossibleâ€”have faith, keep trusting God, 
			and believe that you can do it.
		</p>
